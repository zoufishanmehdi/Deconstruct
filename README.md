# Political-Risk-Analysis


Project Name: Deconstruct
Team Member(s): Zoufishan Mehdi

Project Description:
Deconstruct allows users to be in the know about international security. From business leaders and stakeholders on international security challenges to any curious mind can find up-to-date breaking news, explore country risk profiles at a glance or in-depth in order to inform their decision-making process in investing.

The Problem:
Whether itâ€™s travel or investing in a foreign country, people have a limited scope of the geopolitical context throughout the world. Doing so requires time consuming and in-depth research into various facets of a country and discern between reliable sources. Without a firm grounding the international security, it becomes difficult to conduct political risk analysis and asses whether a investing decision is viable or not.

The Solution:
Providing a seamless user experience to assess political risk in various countries at a glance or in-depth and make informed decisions. 

Baseline features:
Breaking news headlines
3D Globe (Whirly) color coded based on level of risk
Tap on a pin to view country risk profile at a glance
View details i.e. security, economic measures and infrastructure 


Bonus Features:
strengths vs. weakness
trending business headlines 
ability to take notes?
the selected pin becomes highlighted and the background fades 
Take a peek into a country via Google Earth
